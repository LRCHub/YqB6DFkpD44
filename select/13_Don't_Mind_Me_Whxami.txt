I don't seem to feel alright no more
I'm not sure if I'll be living or dying
I used to think suicide could fix all my
troubles now I'm torn between the gun and who I'm with
Baby please just sleep don't worry bout me
if I don't dip I'll call you when the sun rises
But sometimes I feel afraid to say what I
think maybe I'm crazy well I hope you don't mind it

Bad thoughts running up a race in my mind
While I'm screaming only so much I can take say I'm fine
But i lied don't want you worried I'ma take some my time
Try and pull myself outta this place
Motha fuck friends you is a punk bitch
Something that I learned is no one gives a
fuck about you less there's money to be earned
Why is everyone the same
Why is everyone so fake
Why you wonder why I feel it's best to go our separate ways

Anxiety depression from the outside hidden
never found right away unless you ask I ain't tellin
Pills I ain't with because the pills tell me take my
fuckin life and leave me shaking in the night time really
Don't know who to trust and people smile wide thinking
that we homies but I know it ain't in my best interest
Tell lies people always tell lies just to get
on my side I'll run away don't ask why I'm dipping

I don't seem to feel alright no more
I'm not sure if I'll be living or dying
I used to think suicide could fix all my
troubles now I'm torn between the gun and who I'm with
Baby please just sleep don't worry bout me
if I don't dip I'll call you when the sun rises
But sometimes I feel afraid to say what I
think maybe I'm crazy well I hope you don't mind it
