Don't mind me
I'm somewhere in between
Closed eyes and a dream
Closed eyes and a dream,
Don't mind me
Comb through the pictures
Search and seizure
I'm somewhere in between a coma and some anesthesia,
Somewhere in between
Closed eyes and a dream
Closed eyes and a dream (dream dream dream dream)
Don't mind me (comb through the pictures)
I'm somewhere in between (search and seizure)
Closed eyes and a dream (somewhere in between)
Closed eyes and a dream (Between a coma and your anesthesia)
Somewhere in between
Closed eyes and a dream
Opening boxes,
Looking for closure.
You point to the sky
If only you knew
I'm so much closer yeah
Yeah it's alright,
I'm right by your side,
Just over your shoulder
I came here to handle my business
I came here to dust off the sofa
Have you canceled my Hulu subscription?
You opened my drawer and went through some more, some letters, a few of the pictures
You made a collage, a souvenir version of me,
curated, perfect and neat,
Rebuilt the memories,
resaid the words that I speak,
Reborn through the dirt and the weeds.
Yeah,
Formaldehyde
Maybe you don't have to cry.
Get the scraps
piece me back to life,
Ignore the static
Getting more erratic
Close the boxes up and put that shit up in the attic
I'm running outta space up there like you won't imagine
I'm running outta space up there I don't know what happened
I don't know where I went
I don't know where I went
Left for some air, tied to the wind, out through the vent
Don't mind me
I'm somewhere in between
Closed eyes and a dream
Closed eyes and a dream,
Don't mind me
Comb through the pictures
Search and seizure
I'm somewhere in between,
a coma and some anesthesia
Somewhere in between
Closed eyes and a dream.
Mmmm
Opening boxes looking for closure
Standing right here
I shoulda told ya
Over your shoulder
Point to the sky but I'm somewhere much closer
And now it's hard to try
I could cry
I'll help you on the other side
On the other side (on the other side)
On the other side (on the other side)
On the other side (on the other side)
On the other side (on the other side)
