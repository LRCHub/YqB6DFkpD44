Ohh
All you had to do was right by me
These mistakes we make can't rewind
Fucked your friend didn't know baby don't mind me
Cause you ain't even a girl I claim as mine
I fucked your friend didn't know baby don't mind me
Don't mind me (don't mind, don't mind me)
Don't mind, don't mind me
Don't mind, don't mind me
Baby we're both creepin' she ain't even in my starting lineup
Girl your always on your defence
Miss me like the final shot when times up
I can't fall into no feelings
I fuck who I want nah you ain't my girl
And how you talking to me crazy
You know that I love my peace of mind girl
All you had to do was right by me
These mistakes we make can't rewind
Fucked your friend didn't know baby don't mind me
Cause you ain't even a girl I claim as mine
I fucked your friend didn't know baby don't mind me
Don't mind me (don't mind, don't mind me)
Don't mind, don't mind me
Don't mind, don't mind me
What makes you think I'd
Rather be with you right now
You gave me nothing but reasons
I should leave you out
She turns me up then threw it back
How'd she know I like it like that
The difference is you got attached
No wonder your down bad like that
All you had to do was right by me
These mistakes we make can't rewind
Fucked your friend didn't know baby don't mind me
Cause you ain't even a girl I claim as mine
I fucked your friend didn't know baby don't mind me
Don't mind me (don't mind, don't mind me)
Don't mind, don't mind me
Don't mind, don't mind me
Don't mind don't mind me
