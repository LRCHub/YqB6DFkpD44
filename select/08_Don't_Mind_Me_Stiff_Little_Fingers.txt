You live in a world
So full of dreams
Don't see things as they are
But rather as they seem
And what you say
You don't do
You talk about me
When it's all about you

Well, don't mind me
Take what you need
Do as you please
And leave me be
Yeah, don't mind me
Take what you need
Do as you please
And leave me be
Don't mind me
Don't mind me

And all the deals
You brought to me
Supposed to set me up
Yet brought me to my knees
A joint affair
Just you and me
Meant I do all the work
And you keep all the fee

Well, don't mind me
Take what you need
Do as you please
And leave me be
Yeah, don't mind me
Take what you need
Do as you please
And leave me be
Don't mind me
Don't mind me

You can't tell tell truth from lies
You're caught between your shite and your alibis
I'll tell you straight to keep you right
Just pack up your crap
And get out of my life

Well, don't mind me
Take what you need
Do as you please
And leave me be
Yeah, don't mind me
Take what you need
Do as you please
And leave me be
Don't mind me
Don't mind me
