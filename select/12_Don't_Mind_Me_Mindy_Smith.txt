Don't mind me, I'm just sitting here lonely
Don't find me when I'm feeling sad
'Cause my hell's breaking loose
And I don't know what to do, so don't you mind me

Don't come for me, I've been drinking and I'm angry
Don't call for me, I'm not answering the phone
'Cause my hell's breaking lose
And I don't know what to do, so don't you come for me

I need some time alone
Yeah you know I need, I need some time alone

Don't wait for me, it's a waste of your time and mine
If you would only free me, I'd be on my way to fine
'Cause my hell's breaking loose
And I don't know what to do, so don't you wait for me

And I, I need some time alone
You know I need, I need some time alone

So don't mind me, I'm just sitting here lonely
Don't find me when I'm feeling sad, no
'Cause my hell's breaking loose
And I don't know what to do, so don't you mind me
